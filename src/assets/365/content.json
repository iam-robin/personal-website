      "description": "After work, I had a lunch date in the city and found myself in an area near the train station that I don’t visit often. I decided to take a moment to get off my bike and capture the lively atmosphere and the beautiful light on the street. There’s a lot happening in this photo compared to my typical photography style, but I really like how it conveys the mood in this moment.",
