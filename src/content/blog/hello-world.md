# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using **Astro**. Welcome to my blog!

## Why Astro?

Astro is an amazing framework for content-focused websites. Here are some features I love:

-   **Performance**: Astro sites are blazingly fast
-   **Component Islands**: Use your favorite UI components
-   **Content Collections**: Perfect for blogs and documentation

Stay tuned for more posts!
