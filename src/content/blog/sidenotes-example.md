# Using Sidenotes in Markdown

In academic writing and digital publishing, sidenotes provide a reader-friendly alternative to
footnotes. Instead of requiring readers to jump to the bottom of the page, sidenotes appear in the
margin right alongside the relevant text.[^1]

## How to Create Sidenotes

Creating sidenotes in markdown is easy. You simply use the standard markdown footnote syntax, and
our styling will automatically convert them to sidenotes on desktop and toggleable notes on
mobile.[^2]

```markdown
This is text with a sidenote.[^1]

[^1]: This is the sidenote content.
```

## Why Use Sidenotes?

Sidenotes improve the reading experience in several ways:

1. They provide context without disrupting the flow of reading[^3]
2. They're immediately visible without requiring scrolling
3. They make better use of the whitespace available in wide screen layouts

When writing digital content, consider using sidenotes for:

-   Additional context
-   Citations and references
-   Tangential thoughts
-   Humorous asides[^4]

[^1]: This is a sidenote! It appears in the margin on desktop and as a toggleable note on mobile.
[^2]: On mobile devices, click the sidenote number to expand the note.
[^3]:
    According to research on reading comprehension, minimizing context switching improves
    understanding and retention of material.

    writing.
