description: Snapshot late in the evening on the way home from the theater. I had in mind that I was not yet satisfied with the 2-3 photos I had taken so far that day, so I let my photo eye work a little. Although it's a snapshot and the lighting conditions were anything but good for my Ricoh, I'm quite satisfied.
