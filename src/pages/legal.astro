                <p>
                    As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in
                    accordance with general legislation pursuant to Section 7 (1) of the German
                    Telemedia Act (TMG). According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated
                    as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information
                    or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to
                    remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected.
                    However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at
                    which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of
                    any such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.

                <p>
                    Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose
                    contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for
                    these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is
                    always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were
                    checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents
                    were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of
                    the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of
                    a violation of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove
                    such links immediately.

                    The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject
                    to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution and any kind of
                    exploitation outside the limits of copyright require the written consent of the
                    respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only
                    permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site
                    was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected.
                    In particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you
                    nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us
                    accordingly. If we become aware of any infringements, we will remove such
                    content immediately.

                    The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very
                    seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the
                    statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy. The use of our
                    website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as
                    personal data (for example name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on
                    our pages, this is always done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. This
                    data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. We
                    point out that data transmission over the Internet (eg communication by e-mail)
                    security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is
                    not possible.
